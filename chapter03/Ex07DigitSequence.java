	/*I build a class - Ex07DigitSequence and built with java 7, my class implements
	 * Iterator<Integer> and so my Ex07DigitSequence implements 3 methods, including 
	 * a do-nothing "remove" method. The second class is a demo class which prints the 
	 * numbers. 
	 * The demo class ran well in java 8. and I could had used the forEachRemaining method.
	 * In addition - after compiling the classes and gathering them in  a "Jar" 
	 * file(the compiled files) - I still could make use and could call the "forEachRemaining" method
	 * because it's a default method and the call "myObject.for..." is actually a call to 
	 * "Iterator.forEa..."
	 * The "Jar" file is the External_Sources directory.
